## Credit Risk Classification

Credit risk poses a classification problem thatâ€™s inherently imbalanced. This is because healthy loans easily outnumber risky loans. In this Challenge, we use various techniques to train and evaluate models with imbalanced classes. We use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.
